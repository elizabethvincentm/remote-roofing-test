## Technical and architectural choices:

### Why React?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) because the UI framework is really robust, fast and secure. It is also a very popular framework which has a lot of community support and has many ready to use solutions available which makes the development time shorter.

### Why Tailwindcss

Project uses tailwindcss as the CSS utility. Having functional css to work with makes creating composable components a breeze.
There are a lot of utility classes and other configurable plugins which helps in building styles.

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

- Add animations
- Work on a better UI design
- Add filter and sort options

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

I would try to come up with a better UX and Visual design. Also I would have loved to integrate authentication layer.

#### HomePage

- Mock buttons are provided for 'login' and 'Start your free trial'.

#### Movies Page
